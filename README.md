# HW-SW-partitioning-based-on-simple-simulated-annealing

Hardware/software partitioning is very critical step in embedded system, which can help to obtain the best
performance in the limited cost or can decrease the cost in the limited performance.In this project, we chose
the simple simulated annealing algorithm to implement, the related paper is System Level Hardware/Software
Partitioning Based on Simulated Annealing and Tabu Search. In this project, we implemented a simple simulated 
annealing alogorithm to maximize performance in terms of execution speed.
