1. There are two kinds of computation. The first one is to compute the computation intensity, and the second one is to compute the communication intensity.

2. You can change the name of the input assembly file from the main function 

For example:
	a = "pptExample.txt"  means the input assembly file name is "pptExample.txt"

"pptExample.txt" file should be inside the same file as CompCL, and CompCI.

3. There is a psocTable.txt which is used for table look up

4. There are four files, which are CompCI.py, CompCL.py, pptExample.txt, psocTable

There are two output files, which are pptExampleCI.txt, and pptExampleCL.txt
